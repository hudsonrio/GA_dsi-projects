Caveats:
"1. Death rates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560) are available only for 1999-2000. For 2001 and beyond, death"
"counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city have been combined with those for Alleghany county, Virginia (FIPS code"
"51005). Death counts and population estimates for this entity from multi-year requests, only reflect data from 1999 and 2000;"
"for 2001 and beyond they have been set to zero. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Clifton Forge."
"2. Deaths and population estimates are shown separately from the adjacent counties for Carson City, Nevada (FIPS code 32510)."
"3. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for St. Louis City (FIPS code 29510) and county (FIPS code 29189)."
"4. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"5. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"6. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"7. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
