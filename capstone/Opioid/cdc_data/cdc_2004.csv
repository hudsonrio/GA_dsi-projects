Caveats:

"Municipality, AK (FIPS code 02230), Petersburg Borough/Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02195) and Wrangell City and Borough, AK (FIPS"
"code 02275) are only available for 2014 and later; for computational purposes, counts and population estimates for 2013 and"

"2. Death rates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560) are available only for 1999-2000. For 2001 and beyond, death"
"counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city have been combined with those for Alleghany county, Virginia (FIPS code"

"7. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"

"9. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
