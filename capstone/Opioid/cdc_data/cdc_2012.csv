Caveats:
"1. Data for Prince of Wales-Hyder Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02198), Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02105), Skagway"
"Municipality, AK (FIPS code 02230), Petersburg Borough/Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02195) and Wrangell City and Borough, AK (FIPS"
"code 02275) are only available for 2014 and later; for computational purposes, counts and population estimates for 2013 and"
"earlier are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year requests for this entity do not include any data for years"
"before 2014, only data for 2014 and later. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Alaska2014."
"2. Death rates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560) are available only for 1999-2000. For 2001 and beyond, death"
"counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city have been combined with those for Alleghany county, Virginia (FIPS code"
"51005). Death counts and population estimates for this entity from multi-year requests, only reflect data from 1999 and 2000;"
"for 2001 and beyond they have been set to zero. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Clifton Forge."
"3. Deaths and population estimates are shown separately from the adjacent counties for Carson City, Nevada (FIPS code 32510)."

"5. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for St. Louis City (FIPS code 29510) and county (FIPS code 29189)."

"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"7. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"

"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."

"9. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
