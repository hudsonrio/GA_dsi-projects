Caveats:
"1. Data for Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02201), Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, AK (FIPS code"
"02232) and Wrangell-Petersburg Census Area, AK (FIPS code 02280) are only available for 2013 and earlier; for computational"
"purposes, counts and population estimates for 2014 and later are set to zero. Thus, counts and rates shown in multi-year"
"requests for this entity do not include any data for years after 2013, only data for 2013 and earlier. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Alaska2014."
"2. Deaths and population estimates are reported separately for Baltimore City (FIPS code 24510) and Baltimore county (FIPS code"
"24005)."
"3. Death rates are flagged as Unreliable when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Unreliable."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
"so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"5. Deaths of persons with Hispanic origin ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among"
"Hispanic Origin groups, so are not included in the Hispanic Origin specific counts and rates. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Not Stated."
"6. Information included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the"
"funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis"
"of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin"
"are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. More information:"
